<h2>General <strong>Information</strong></h2>

<p>
The objective of this course is to present to research engineers the foundations of and recent developments within integrated computational materials engineering (ICME).  ICME promises designers and engineers the potential to shorten product and process development time using computational design methods.  This workshop will focus on the fundamental engineering problems addressed by ICME, computational components (and their integration) of ICME, and both recent developments and open questions in the field. The target audience consists of materials researchers from academia and industry who desire a review of current practices, open questions, and cutting-edge techniques in computational materials science and its incorporation into ICME.
</p>

<p>
  This example-driven three-day research workshop, hosted by
  <a href="http://cse.illinois.edu">Computational Science and Engineering</a>
  at the University of Illinois, will introduce researchers to the elements
  of integrated computational materials engineering (ICME).
  Lectures and tutorials will alternate with hands-on practical exercises, and
  participants are encouraged both to help one another, and to try applying
  what they have learned to their own research problems during and between
  sessions. Participants should bring their own laptops to work on for hands-on
  components—contact
  <a href="mailto:davis68@illinois.edu">Neal Davis</a> if you need special
  accomodation.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The target audience for this research workshop is academic researchers—
  faculty, postdoctoral students, graduate students, and other researchers—
  who are interested in exploring the new field of ICME to further their
  insight into processes and structures.
